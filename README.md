# Speech Emotion Recognizer
## Overview
This repository contains a Deep Learning-based Speech Emotion Recognizer implemented using various deep learning architectures. The system aims to recognize emotions from speech signals using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Datasets
The system is trained and evaluated on four different datasets:

[RAVDESS]: A dataset comprising emotional speech clips with a diverse range of emotions expressed.
[SAVEE]: A dataset consisting of British English speakers expressing seven different emotions.
