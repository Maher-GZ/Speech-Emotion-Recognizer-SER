# Speech Emotion Recognizer 

## Overview
This repository contains a Deep Learning-based Speech Emotion Recognizer implemented using various deep learning architectures. The system aims to recognize emotions from speech signals using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Datasets
The system is trained and evaluated on four different Kaggle datasets:

1. [RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio/code?datasetId=107620&sortBy=voteCount): A dataset comprising emotional speech clips with a diverse range of emotions expressed.
2. [SAVEE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee): A dataset consisting of British English speakers expressing seven different emotions.
3. [Tess](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess): A dataset containing emotional speech recordings performed by a female speaker.
4. [Crema](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhavikjain/audio-emotions): A dataset of emotional speech clips from the Crema-D dataset.

Each dataset offers a unique set of emotional expressions and provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating the Speech Emotion Recognizer.

## Optimized Model 
Editing on [Speech Emotion Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivamburnwal/speech-emotion-recognition) on Kaggle as follows ....

Improved the accuracy by up to 9% (from 66% to 75% in val_accuracy) and reduced the loss by 20% (from 1 to 0.8).
Reduced the processing time by 35%.
