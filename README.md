# Speech Emotion Recognizer 
## Overview
This repository contains a Deep Learning-based Speech Emotion Recognizer implemented using various deep learning architectures. The system aims to recognize emotions from speech signals using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Datasets
The system is trained and evaluated on four different datasets:

(RAVDESS)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio/code?datasetId=107620&sortBy=voteCount]: A dataset comprising emotional speech clips with a diverse range of emotions expressed.
